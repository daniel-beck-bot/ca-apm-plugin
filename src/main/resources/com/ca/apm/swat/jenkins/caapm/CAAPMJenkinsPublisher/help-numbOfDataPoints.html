<div>
Specify the number of data points that needs to be considered along with the frequency. 
<br>Minimum data points defaults to 10 and max is 50. 
<br> if no value is set then the default value of 30 with frequency of 15 sec is assumed
<br>The data points are calculated starting from the beginning of ca-apm task.
<br> For e.g. if jenkins build started at 10 and CA APM task started at 11, after 
completing other intermediate tasks, and if the data points specified is 20 with 1 minute frequency then
data point that will be considered will be between 10:40 and 11 i.e going back 20 mts starting from 11.
<br>If interested in all the data points from the start of the build pls check the check box.
<br>Max of 50 data points will be considered. 
<br>The resolution will be automatically calculated based on the length of the build time and rounded to the closest 15 sec, 1 minute or 1 hour.
<br>if checked then only this is considered and data point field is ignored.
<br> if the number data points available is less then 10 then the build is considered a failure.
